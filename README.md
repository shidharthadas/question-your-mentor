# Question Your Mentor

This project is based on Django REST framework. Below are the Use Case:

    - Implement multiple API endpoints to post questions to Mentor.

    - Application must be having userâ€™s with two roles: User and Mentor. (Mentor will be created by the System Admin.)

    - User should be able to register account and login.

    - User must be able to send queries to Mentor. Message includes document attachment also.

    - Mentor must be able to view and respond to all the queries received to him.

    - Use customized user model and make email as username

    - Use Django password validator. (Password should contain minimum 8 letters, 2 numbers and 2 special chars)

    - Use JWT Authentication to protect the endpoints.

    - Use DRF Exception Hander and return generic error response.

    - Use Serializers to validate the user request

    - Use multiple roles (e.g. USER, MENTOR,..) and the endpoints can be accessed based on the roles.

    - Use SMTP email background(Gmail) and signals for notification (Optional)

    - Log every endpoint access (Optional)

    - Use Swagger for API documentation (Optional)
